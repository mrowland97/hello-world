# hello-world
For a school assignment

Hello, my name is Mark Rowland, and I am interested in learning software development, with plans on becoming a software engineer. The language that I am currently learning in school is Python, and I am having a lot of fun learning it.
After I learn and become comfortable with Python, I want to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so that way I can start learning some front-end web development.
